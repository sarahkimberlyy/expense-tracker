## üì¶ How to Run the App

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarahkimberlyy/expense-tracker.git
cd expense-tracker
```

### 2. Create `.env` file from template

Copy the example environment file and edit it with your database credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Make sure `.env` contains:

```env
POSTGRES_DB=expenses
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit `.env` to version control. Only `.env.example` should be tracked.

```
```

### 3. Start the app with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:

* Build and run the **frontend** on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Start the **backend API** on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
* Launch the **PostgreSQL** database with persistent volume

---

## ‚úÖ Testing the App

* Access frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Access backend directly: [http://localhost:3001/api/expenses](http://localhost:3001/api/expenses)
* Try adding, editing, and deleting expense records.
* Filter by category or date. Pagination also works!

---

## üßπ Common Issues

### ‚ùå 502 Bad Gateway

If the frontend shows a 502:

* Make sure backend container is running and healthy.
* Restart with:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```
